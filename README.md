## Installation
```npm install nosqlax```

## Getting started
1. Define your entity by extanding the BaseEntity. Specify it's type, the schema and the mapping between the entity properties and the CouchDB document. The schema can either be represented by and AJV object or the schema ID (we will see later how to pass ajv options with your schema corresponding to this ID to the repository.
```
const { BaseEntity } = require('nosqlax');  // Your library
// AJV schema for User validation
const userSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    email: { type: 'string', format: 'email' },
    name: { type: 'string' },
    contact: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        email: { type: 'string', format: 'email' },
      },
    },
  },
  required: ['email', 'name'],
};
class User extends BaseEntity {
  static type = 'user';  
  static schemaOrSchemaId = userSchema; 
  static fieldMap = {
    email: 'email',  // Entity's email field is mapped to 'email' in the document
    name: 'name'
    type: 'docType', // The type (here 'user', is specified by the docType property in the couchdb document
    contactEmail: 'contact.email',  // Entity's contactEmail field is mapped to 'contact.email' in the document
  };

  constructor(data) {
    super(data);
    this.email = data.email;
    this.name = data.name;
    this.contactEmail = data.contactEmail;
  }
}

module.exports = User;
```
